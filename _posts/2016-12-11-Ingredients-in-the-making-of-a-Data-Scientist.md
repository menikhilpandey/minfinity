With advancements in technology, data is ever growing. Gone are the days when people were satisfied with 100 MB storage on their systems and companies were striving to limit their data usage. Now, even 8-year-old kids have 1 TB storage devices and perform transaction of GBs of data on the internet on daily basis.

Let's just take an insight of our data usage, every day most of us use the internet to browse some website, maybe to do window shopping or search google about random stuff. While doing so, we are downloading and uploading MBs of data in a matter of minutes. 

Data is more affordable now than it was ever, billion of people use internet and products based on the internet. All this data is stored by the companies, every single bit of it.

But why? With growing data, competition in the market is also growing day by day. In the present world, when someone thinks of an idea about a product, hundreds of similar products are already up and running in the market. In fact, one of top industry professional said to me that if the problem you're trying to solve was mentioned in the newspaper in past 7 months, there is a solution up and running for sure, which is somewhat true.

Customers will only stick to your company when they get what they need that too in lesser time that what others are offering, thus, to deal with this ever-growing competition, companies need to draw insights about their product and its usage by different customers and uncover better business models to deliver customers efficiently and rapidly. Businesses which are more into service, need to understand drawbacks of the current process and make adjustments to deal with the drawbacks.

This is when data science comes into play. Wikipedia says

> Data science is an interdisciplinary field about processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured, which is a continuation of some of the data analysis fields such as statistics, machine learning, data mining, and predictive analytics.

This is a formal definition of data science. Basically, it's just drawing useful insights from data.

#### How to become a data scientist?

Data scientists are data wranglers. Think of data scientists as computer programs that take mammoth messy data points as input and process the data using their skills in math, statistics, programming to organize them, apply their analytic powers (industry knowledge & contextual understanding) to output hidden solutions to business challenges. 

I read somewhere that,

> A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.

which is somewhat true.

It is very clear from the Venn diagram that to become a unicorn one needs to have adequate knowledge of three things:

1. Computer science, which involves development and programming skills.  
2. Subject Matter Expertise, which is basically having knowledge of businesses.
3. Math & Statistics, which is very native yet broad field.

The combination of 1 & 2 makes you a perfect fit for the software industry.
The combination of 2 & 3 makes you a perfect fit for research field focussing on business development.
The combination of 1 & 3 is what is known as machine learning.

But an adequate knowledge in all these three fields makes you the unicorn. I will put more emphasis on adequate as one need not be master of programming and development or have done Ph.D. in math & statistics or be an expert analyst for being a data scientist. However, having expertise in related fields gives you an edge over others. 

Least requirements for all three fields can be sum up in following way:

* For 1, one needs to have good knowledge in either Python or R, having knowledge of both is extremely helpful when you are willing to work in service based companies.
* For 2, it totally depends on the company you work for, mostly fresh recruits are given business insights in their training period.
* For 3, one needs to know the basic theorems and proofs in linear algebra (with the focus on matrix algebra), calculus (basic integration and partial derivatives), optimization functions, probability (knowledge till senior secondary is enough), statistics (strong grasp on random variables, probability distributions, descriptive statistics).

Being a unicorn (data scientist) is the hottest job of the century, with salaries ranging from $ 70k - 180k and median salary being $ 140k for fresh recruits in India, Europe & USA, this profession is becoming one of the most sought after professions.

Be a unicorn!
